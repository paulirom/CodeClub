This Blog is an attempt to document the content of our CodeClub sessions in a transparent and accessible way. It uses the *blogdown* package to compile several independent .Rmd files into one single Blog.

If you'd like your Markdown to be included in the CodeClub HTML documentation:

  - paste your .Rmd to the ***CodeClubWebsite*** directory on OneDrive
  - make sure, wd is properly set and all dependencies are correctly defined
  - add a reference to your HTML in _site.yml  
  
For more information about simple R Markdown websites, please read the [documentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html).
