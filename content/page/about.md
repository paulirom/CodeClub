This weblog is meant to document the activities of the **UKA R Code Club**. We are a group of R users from different institutes and clinics at Uniklinik RWTH Aachen. We organize regular Code Club Sessions to share and discuss our experiences with R and learn from each other. Our main goal is to improve our skills in data wrangling and statistical analysis with R.
