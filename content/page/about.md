This weblog is meant to document the activities of the **ukaR Code Club**. We are a group of R users from different institutes and clinics at Uniklinik RWTH Aachen. We organize regular Code Club Sessions to share and discuss our experiences with R and learn from each other. Our main goal is to improve our skills in data wrangling and statistical analysis with R, primarily working with human-related research data.

As a member of the ukaR Code Club, you can contribute to this weblog by following these simple steps:

  - go to the shared project repository (Blogdown > CodeClub > content > post > blogpost template)
  - open *blogposttemplate.md*
  - change *title*, *subtitle*, *author*, *date*, *categories* and *tags*
  - change the contents and/or add code
  - choose a filename and save as *filename.md* to the *blogpost template* folder
  - done! Your contribution will be posted with the next update of the weblog
